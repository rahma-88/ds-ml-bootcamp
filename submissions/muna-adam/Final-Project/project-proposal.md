**Pulmonary Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning**

## Project Description

This project aims to predict whether a person is at risk of pulmonary disease using demographic information, lifestyle habits, medical history, and health-related symptoms.

The machine learning model analyzes features such as:

- Age
- Smoking status
- Exposure to pollution
- Breathing issues
- Oxygen saturation (SpO₂)
- Family history of pulmonary disease
- Other relevant health indicators

Based on these features, the model classifies individuals as either:

- **At Risk of Pulmonary Disease**
- **Not At Risk of Pulmonary Disease**

The project demonstrates how machine learning can support healthcare researchers, students, and medical professionals by assisting in disease risk prediction and early assessment using healthcare data.

## 3. Problem Type

### Classification (Binary Classification)

This project is a **binary classification** problem because the objective is to predict a categorical outcome rather than a continuous numerical value. The target variable, **PULMONARY_DISEASE**, has two possible classes:

- **1** – Has Pulmonary Disease
- **0** – Does Not Have Pulmonary Disease

The machine learning model learns patterns from patient information, including:

- Age
- Smoking status
- Exposure to pollution
- Breathing issues
- Oxygen saturation (SpO₂)
- Family history
- Other health-related features

Using these inputs, the model predicts whether an individual is **at risk of pulmonary disease** or **not at risk of .

# 5. Algorithms You Plan to Train

The following machine learning algorithms will be trained and compared to determine which model performs best for predicting pulmonary disease.

| Algorithm | Why It Fits This Problem |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Logistic Regression** | Logistic Regression is a strong baseline algorithm for binary classification and predicts whether a patient has pulmonary disease (1) or not (0). |
| **Decision Tree Classifier** | Decision Tree can capture non-linear relationships between patient characteristics and disease status, while also providing easy-to-understand decision rules. |
| **Random Forest Classifier** | Random Forest combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy, reduce overfitting, and handle complex healthcare data effectively. |
| **XGBoost Classifier** | XGBoost is an advanced ensemble learning algorithm that often achieves high performance by efficiently learning complex patterns in structured datasets. |

# 6. Evaluation Plan

To evaluate and compare the performance of the machine learning models, the following classification metrics will be used:

- **Accuracy** – Measures the overall percentage of correctly classified predictions.
- **Precision** – Measures how many patients predicted to have pulmonary disease actually have the disease.
- **Recall** – Measures how many actual pulmonary disease cases are correctly identified by the model.
- **F1-Score** – Combines Precision and Recall into a single metric, providing a balanced measure of model performance.

## Best Model Selection

The **F1-Score** will be used as the primary metric to select the best model.

**Reason:** In disease prediction, both **False Positives** and **False Negatives** are important. A model with a high F1-Score balances **Precision** and **Recall**, making it more reliable for identifying patients at risk while minimizing incorrect predictions. Therefore, F1-Score is a more suitable metric than Accuracy alone for this binary classifica

tion problem.able metric than Accuracy alone for selecting the best overall model.

## 7. Deployment Sketch

### Deployment Method

This project will be deployed using **Streamlit**, which provides an interactive web application for the machine learning model. Users will enter patient information through a simple web interface, and the application will instantly display the predicted lung cancer risk level.

## User Input

The Streamlit application will allow users to enter the following information:

- Age
- Gender
- Smoking
- Finger Discoloration
- Mental Stress
- Exposure to Pollution
- Long-Term Illness
- Energy Level
- Immune Weakness
- Breathing Issue
- Alcohol Consumption
- Throat Discomfort
- Oxygen Saturation
- Chest Tightness
- Family History
- Smoking Family History
- Stress Immune

## Output

After clicking the **Predict** button, the application will display:

- **Predicted Pulmonary Disease Status** (Yes or No)
- **Prediction Confidence (%)**
- **Risk Status:** High Risk or Low Risk based on the model's prediction
