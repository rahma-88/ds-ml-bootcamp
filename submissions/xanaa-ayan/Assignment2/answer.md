## 1. Title & Collection Method

* **Title of Dataset:** Mogadishu Flight Ticket Prices Dataset
* [cite_start]**Collection Method:** This dataset was compiled using **Manual Observation and Logging** (Manual Data Collection)[cite: 36]. 
* [cite_start]**Data Sources:** The data was gathered by checking local airline booking portals, official social media pages (Facebook), and travel agency price sheets operating within Mogadishu, Somalia[cite: 37]. [cite_start]Prices reflect flights departing from **Aden Adde International Airport (MGQ)** to key domestic and international destinations[cite: 38].

## 2. Description of Features & Labels

[cite_start]To build a machine learning model that predicts ticket prices, the dataset is structured with the following variables[cite: 39]:

### Features ($X$)
* [cite_start]**Airline (Categorical):** The operating airline company (e.g., Daallo, Freedom, Salaama, Qatar Airways, Ethiopian Airlines)[cite: 39].
* [cite_start]**Destination (Categorical):** The arrival airport city (e.g., Hargeisa, Garowe, Nairobi, Istanbul, Addis Ababa)[cite: 40].
* [cite_start]**Class (Categorical):** The seating tier, representing travel comfort level (Economy or Business)[cite: 41].
* [cite_start]**Days_Before_Flight (Numerical):** The exact number of days remaining between the booking date and the actual flight departure date[cite: 42].

### Label ($y$)
* [cite_start]**Price (Numerical):** The cost of the flight ticket in USD ($)[cite: 43]. [cite_start]This is the continuous target variable we want our model to predict[cite: 44].

## 4. Quality Issues (Anomalies Located)

[cite_start]Because this data was logged manually from live, changing booking channels, it mimics real-world data friction[cite: 55]. [cite_start]The following data quality issues were intentionally preserved or found[cite: 56]:

* [cite_start]**Missing Values:** Some entries lack the airline name (labeled as `Missing`), representing skipped inputs during fast manual collection[cite: 57].
* [cite_start]**Inconsistent Casing/Typos:** The `Class` column contains structural text discrepancies, such as lowercase `economy` instead of standard capitalized `Economy`[cite: 58].
* [cite_start]**Duplicate Rows:** Identical flight entries appear multiple times (e.g., Daallo flights to Hargeisa at row 1 and row 9), which can bias model training[cite: 59].
* [cite_start]**Outliers / Logical Errors:** The `Days_Before_Flight` feature contains negative values (e.g., `-3`, `-5`), which is a logical physical impossibility for advance booking[cite: 60].

## 5. Learning Type

[cite_start]This is a **Supervised Learning** problem[cite: 61].

> **Justification:**
> [cite_start]The dataset contains a definitive, explicit target output label ($y$) which is the **Price**[cite: 61]. [cite_start]The objective is to train a machine learning algorithm by feeding it the historical input features ($X$: Airline, Destination, Class, Days Before Flight) along with the corresponding correct outputs ($y$), so it learns the mapping function to predict ticket pricing for completely new, unseen booking parameters[cite: 62].

## 6. Use Case & Data Science Lifecycle

* [cite_start]**Machine Learning Use Case:** This dataset fits a **Regression** task because the target label (Price) is a continuous numeric value, not a distinct categorical group[cite: 63].
* [cite_start]**Placement in the Data Science Lifecycle:** This assignment represents the **Data Collection** stage (Phase 2)[cite: 64].
